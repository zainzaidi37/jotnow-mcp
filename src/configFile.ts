 *

 * `jotnow use local` must be recordable on a machine that has no key at all.
 * The one cost, stated because it is the mirror image of the rule above: a
 * config written by `jotnow use local` before any `jotnow key` has no `apiKey`,
 * and a CLI older than this one rejects that file as "unexpected shape". A
 * machine that has only ever chosen local mode has nothing for an older CLI to
 * do, and the alternative — refusing to record the mode without a key — leaves

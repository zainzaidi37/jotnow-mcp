// The two-process get-or-create race (plans/desktop-app.md §4.9, §6, §9; the
// last item WP6 owed that no in-process test can reach).
//
// What it proves: several **genuinely separate OS processes** writing
// `jotnow add`-shaped notes into one local library, all claiming the same
// folder names and the same tag names at the same moment, end with exactly one
// folder per name, exactly one tag per name, every note present and correctly
// linked, and no `SQLITE_BUSY` surfaced to any of them.
//
// What makes that true is three things, and this test fails if any of them is
// removed: WAL (set by the desktop app at creation), the explicit
// `busy_timeout` on the CLI's own connection (§4.3 — sqlx's defaults cover the
// app's connections only), and the get-or-create *reads* running inside
// `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (PR C's review round). The third is the one this test was
// written for: with the folder/tag lookups outside the transaction, every
// process reads "no folder named Race 0", every process plans one, and every
// process inserts one — N folders with the same name, **no error anywhere**,
// and no unique index in the SQLite schema to object. Verified by moving those
// reads back out in a working tree: this test then reports duplicate folders
// and duplicate tags, while `save-note.test.ts` and the conformance suite stay
// green, because both are single-process.
//
// The children run a real build of this package rather than its sources — see
// `race-child.mjs` for why, and `buildPackage` below for how.
//
// Still owed, and not claimed here: §4.9 wants this same race on Windows
// against the **MSIX-installed** app, with the desktop app holding the file
// open through its sqlx pool. That is a documented manual runbook
// (`apps/desktop/README.md`, "Two-process race runbook") and a ZAIN-PC visit,
// not this file: a Linux child-process race exercises SQLite's locking, not
// WebView2, AV scanners or MSIX redirection.

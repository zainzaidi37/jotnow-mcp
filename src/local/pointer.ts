// The CLI's half of the pointer file (plans/desktop-app.md §5.3; the app's
// half is `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/pointer.rs`, PR A).
//
// The app writes `~/.kinjot/local-library.json` on every launch, naming the
// database it actually opened plus that library's identity and schema version.
// This module only *reads and parses* it — the handshake that decides whether
// the named file may be written to lives in `library.ts`, because the pointer
// is a hint and never an authority.
//
// Two rules from §5.3 that are easy to lose and are enforced here:
//
//   * a **missing** pointer means "run the desktop app once", not "there is no
//     local library, use the server";
//   * a pointer that is present but unreadable is a hard error. Neither case
//     ever falls through to the account path — that fall-through is the §5.4
//     privacy violation the whole arrangement exists to prevent.

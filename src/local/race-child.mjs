// One OS process of the two-process get-or-create race (plans/desktop-app.md
// §4.9, §6; `race.test.ts` is the parent).
//
// Deliberately **not** a TypeScript file and deliberately **not** imported by
// anything: it is spawned with `child_process.fork`, and it reaches the shipped
// write path by dynamic-importing a build of this package that the parent test
// produced (argv[2]). Two reasons that indirection exists rather than importing
// `./save-note.js` from source:
//
//   * vitest/Vite rewrites the bare `node:sqlite` specifier, which is why
//     `runtime.ts` loads it through `createRequire` — a child that inherited
//     any of vitest's module pipeline would be testing a different loader than
//     the CLI's. A plain `node` child inherits nothing;
//   * Node cannot resolve this package's `./x.js` import specifiers against
//     `.ts` sources, so running the sources directly in a bare child would need
//     a custom resolve hook. Compiling with the package's own
//     `tsconfig.build.json` runs *the artifact users install* instead.
//
// The protocol is three messages: the child reports `ready` once the library is
// open (so the §5.3 handshake is not inside the measured window), the parent
// releases every child at once with `go`, and the child reports the ids it
// wrote. Anything else — a thrown handshake, a `SQLITE_BUSY` — leaves through a
// non-zero exit and stderr, both of which the parent asserts on.

/**
 * `server.json` is the MCP registry's manifest for this package, and it
 * restates facts that already live in package.json — the version, twice, and
 * the npm identifier.
 *
 * Nothing kept them in step. A release that bumped package.json and forgot the
 * manifest would not fail any build: it surfaces later, at publish time, when
 * the registry rejects a `packages[].version` that does not match the version
 * actually on npm. That is a bounded failure, but it is discovered in the
 * middle of a release rather than here.
 *
 * `mcpName` is the field npm exposes for the registry's ownership check, so it
 * has to equal the manifest's `name` or the listing cannot be verified at all.
